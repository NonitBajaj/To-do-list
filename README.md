# To-do-list
This repository contains the code for a cloud-based To-Do List application using ReactJS for the frontend and AWS serverless services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway) for the backend. It allows users to manage tasks and is responsive across devices. The serverless architecture ensures scalability, cost-efficiency, and minimal maintenance.
